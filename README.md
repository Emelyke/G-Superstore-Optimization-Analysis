# G-Superstore-Optimization-Analysis (Using Power BI)
## Project Objective
To Develope an interactive Power BI dashboard for a Superstore, transforming raw data into actionable insights by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and maximize return on investment (ROI).

## Data Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Emelyke/G-Superstore-Optimization-Analysis/blob/main/Copy%20of%20Global%20Superstore.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Problem Statement

-What are our total sales, total profit, order volume, and customer base over the observed period?

-How do monthly sales and profits trend throughout the year?

-How have total sales and profit evolved year over year?

-Who are our top customers based on the number of orders placed?

-Which products generate the highest sales revenue?

-What is the distribution of total sales across customer segments?

-How is sales performance distributed by order priority level?

-Which cities contribute most significantly to total sales and profitability?


-Dashboard Interaction  <a href="https://github.com/Emelyke/Call-Centre-Dashboard/commit/cc6ba6ee896a293c0403cd345c024851eb674ffa">View Dashboard</a>


## Process
-Conducted data quality assessments to identify and address missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

-Standardized and cleaned datasets to ensure consistency across data types, formats, and categorical values for accurate analysis.

-Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to develop calculated columns, measures, and KPIs for extracting actionable performance insights.

-Developed interactive dashboards using visual analytics tools to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and delivered data-driven recommendations based on insights.

## Project Insight

-An average speed of answer at 67.52 seconds, compared to a short talk duration of 30.21 seconds, indicates potential inefficiencies in call handling and agent availability, which potentially leads to customer dissatisfaction.

-There's a spike in unanswered calls during peak hours (9 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM), particularly on weekends and Mondays. This contributes to decreased service efficiency, negatively impacts business performance, and poses a risk to the companyâ€™s reputation due to unmet customer needs.

-A significant proportion of unresolved customer calls occurs during weekends, primarily due to high call volumes that exceed support capacity, resulting in delayed responses, reduced service quality, and ultimately, unresolved customer issues.

-Average customer satisfaction score of 3.40 out of 5 indicates a moderate level of satisfaction, suggesting that while basic expectations are being met, there's significant room for improvement

## Recommendation:

-Improve call routing and optimize agent scheduling to reduce wait times. Implement real-time monitoring and queue management strategies to align agent availability with call volume, enhancing responsiveness and customer experience

-Establish a peer mentorship program by pairing top-performing agents with those underperforming to foster knowledge sharing, improve problem-solving skills, and uplift overall team performance.

-Optimize workforce scheduling by aligning agent availability with peak call hours especially during weekends and Mondays to reduce unanswered calls. Implement call queue management tools and consider self-service options (e.g., IVR, chatbots) to improve response rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and protect brand reputation.

-Implement a continuous training and development program to reinforce best practices, keep agents updated on industry trends, and enhance their ability to deliver effective solutions. This will not only improve individual agent performance but also ensure consistent, high-quality customer satisfaction.

-Implement multichannel support (e.g., live chat, email, and social platforms) to enhance service accessibility and streamline operational efficiency.
