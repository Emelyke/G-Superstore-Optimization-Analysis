# G-Superstore-Optimization-Analysis (Using Power BI)
## Project Objective
To Develope an interactive Power BI dashboard for a Superstore, transforming raw data into actionable insights by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and maximize return on investment (ROI).

## Data Used

## Problem Statement

-What are our total sales, total profit, order volume, and customer base over the observed period?

-How do monthly sales and profits trend throughout the year?

-How have total sales and profit evolved year over year?

-Who are our top customers based on the number of orders placed?

-Which products generate the highest sales revenue?

## Process
-Conducted data quality assessments to identify and address missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

-Standardized and cleaned datasets to ensure consistency across data types, formats, and categorical values for accurate analysis.

-Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to develop calculated columns, measures, and KPIs for extracting actionable performance insights.

-Developed interactive dashboards using visual analytics tools to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and delivered data-driven recommendations based on insights.

## Project Insight

  1. Monthly Trend of Sales and Profit
Insight:
-Sales peak in November ($1.6M), with significant growth starting from June onward.
-Profits remain relatively flat throughout the year, ranging from $71K to $175K, indicating low profit margins.Some months like May and July have similar sales to others but very low profit, suggesting possible discounting or high-cost products.

Recommendation:
-Investigate high-volume months like November to replicate successful campaigns.
-Improve profit margins by revising pricing or supplier negotiations, especially in low-profit months.
-Identify and minimize selling low-margin or loss-making products.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Yearly Total Sales and Profit
Insight:
-Sales and profit both increased steadily from 2011 to 2014, peaking in 2014 with $4.2M in sales and $497K in profit.
-The profit margin is improving but still represents ~11.8% of sales in 2014.

Recommendation:
-Continue investing in growth strategies from 2013â€“2014.
-Analyze what contributed to the performance boost in 2013â€“2014 and replicate or scale those tactics.

Recommendation:
-Continue investing in growth strategies from 2013â€“2014.
-Analyze what contributed to the performance boost in 2013â€“2014 and replicate or scale those tactics.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Top 5 Customers by Orders
Insight:
-The top 6 customers all have over 100 orders, with Muhammad and Steven tied at 106 orders.
-These repeat customers are vital for consistent revenue.

Recommendation:
-Offer loyalty incentives or exclusive deals to retain these top customers.
-Analyze their purchase patterns and tailor future offers or upsells.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Top 5 Products by Sales
Insight:
-Phones ($1.7M) lead the sales, followed by Copiers, Chairs, and Bookcases (all at $1.5M).
These products contribute significantly to overall revenue.
Recommendation:
Promote and stock high-performing items like phones more aggressively.
Review cost structure and profit margins of these products to ensure profitability aligns with revenue.
ï‚·

ðŸ”¹ 5. Total Sales by Segment
Insight:
Consumer segment leads with $6M (51.5%), followed by Corporate (30.2%) and Home Office (18.3%).
Recommendation:
Focus more marketing and product development efforts on the Consumer segment.
Explore upselling/cross-selling opportunities for Corporate and Home Office to increase their share.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Total Sales by Order Priority
Insight:
Medium priority orders dominate (57.6%), followed by High (30.1%).
Critical and Low priorities contribute minimally.
Recommendation:
Evaluate if high-priority and critical orders are being processed efficiently.
Consider promotional offers to shift more customers into high-priority orders (which may imply faster shipping or premium service).

ðŸ”¹ 7. Total Sales and Profit by City
Insight:
New York City has the highest profit ($62K) and sales ($256K).
Manila shows a loss of $11K despite $119K in sales â€” a red flag.
Recommendation:
Investigate operations in Manila to reduce lossesâ€”possibly due to high costs or discounts.
Prioritize and replicate sales strategies from New York and LA in other cities.

ðŸ”¹ Overall Dashboard Summary
Total Sales: $12.6M
Total Profit: $1.46M (~11.6% margin)
Total Orders: 51,004
Customers: 1,590
